# What Are Concatenative Languages?

- **Functional languages**
- Programs built by **concatenating functions**
- **Point-free style** (no named arguments)
- Data manipulated via a **stack**

---

# Historical Background

- **Forth** (1970, Charles Moore)
- **PostScript** (1982, Adobe)
- Modern purely functional:
  - **Joy** (2001)
  - **Factor** (2003)
  - **Cat** (2006)

---

# Core Concepts

- **Concatenation** (functions chained linearly)
- **Point-free syntax**
- **Stack-based data manipulation**
- Functional purity (no side effects, mostly)

---

# Simple Syntax Example (Factor)

```factor
2 4 + 3 *
````

| Step | Operation | Stack   |
| ---- | --------- | ------- |
| 1    | `2`       | `[2]`   |
| 2    | `4`       | `[2,4]` |
| 3    | `+`       | `[6]`   |
| 4    | `3`       | `[6,3]` |
| 5    | `*`       | `[18]`  |

**Result:** `18`

---

# Defining & Using Functions

Define a function (`square`):

```factor
: square ( n -- n² ) dup * ;
```

Use the function:

```factor
5 square .
```

Output: `25`

* `dup` duplicates stack top
* `*` multiplies two top stack items

---

# Realistic Mini-Program in Factor

**Task**: Calculate factorial of a number (e.g., 5 → 120).

Define factorial recursively:

```factor
: factorial ( n -- n! )
    dup 1 <= [ drop 1 ] [ dup 1 - factorial * ] if ;
```

Use it:

```factor
5 factorial .
```

Output: `120`

# Strengths ✅

* Minimal and elegant syntax
* Easy function composition
* Clear data flow (stack-based)
* Efficient optimization potential

---

# Weaknesses ⚠️

* Initial learning curve (stack concept)
* Difficulties managing large stacks
* Limited mainstream adoption
* Less mature tooling/ecosystem

---

# Why Learn Concatenative Languages?

* Improves understanding of functional programming
* Encourages clear, concise thinking
* Broadens your programming knowledge
* Useful for niche, specialized tasks (embedded, graphics, education)
